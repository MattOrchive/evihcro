This is the actual OrchiveApp

Beginning Phase 1

6/16/11:  Created databases for posts, comments, and tags
          Current Status: One can post and comment on a post (tagging doesn't 
          work)

          A post consists of a name (user), title, content, user location 
          (determined by us), post location [where event is occuring] 
          (determined by user), date and time, accuracy and inaccuracy

          One may edit, delete, and show a post
          Showing a post shows details of the post and any comments or tags
          
          A comment consists of a name (commenter) and content
          One may only delete a comment (not edit)



6/18/11:  Made Header (Logo + Navigation Bar) and Footer (Copy, Translation
          [Not Working] and Bottom Links)

          Created skeletons for the static pages (About, Contact, Privacy, 
          Terms). A skeleton is a placeholder page.

          Currently No CSS (Will add in the future)

          Next... Finish static pages
          Then... Either add CSS or build News Feed, Home Page, etc.



6/19/11:  Completed the Static Pages (Meaning added content to them)
          
          Added CSS successfully styling and formatting the pages

          Fixed previous problem with page width... Now all pages are the 
          whole screen

          Next... Build News Feed and Home Page
          Then... Format and Style News Feed and Home Page
          After Then... Tagging System and New Posting (Modals)


6/28/11:  News Feed only needs a little more touching up
          Show Page is next, then the Beta Home Page, 
          then lastly the Posting Interface.
